# Project 4 — Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains several Jupyter notebooks for Project 4 (homework). The notebooks include a template, completed solutions, and copies.

## Files

- `HW4 template.ipynb` — starter notebook with instructions and cells to complete.
- `HW4_done.ipynb` — completed solution notebook.
- `HW4_done - Copy.ipynb` — an extra copy of the completed notebook.
- `HW4 (3).ipynb` — another variant/backup of the homework notebook.

## How to open

If you have Jupyter installed, open the folder and run:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

Or use VS Code: open the folder in VS Code and click any `.ipynb` file to view and run cells.

## Notes

- Notebooks are self-contained; run cells in order to reproduce results.
- If you need to install Python packages used in these notebooks, create/activate a virtual environment and install the packages (the notebooks themselves will indicate any required libraries).
